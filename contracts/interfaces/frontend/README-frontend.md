# ADAM Frontend (Campus Genesis Dashboard)

This folder hosts the React-based dashboard used in the demo video:
- Live metrics for participants, verified actions, BLq minted
- Proof generator UI (simulated ZK proof submission)
- Leaderboard and rewards screen

The implementation used in the hackathon is deployed separately
(to keep this repo lightweight for judges). The UI follows the
Celestial Black & Lalibela Gold design from the pitch deck.
