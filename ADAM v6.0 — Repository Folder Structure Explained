 ADAM v6.0 — Repository Folder Structure 

This repository is organized to reflect the full architecture of ADAM:
a zero-knowledge behavior verification protocol with smart contracts, zk-circuits, interfaces, and frontend documentation.

Below is a clear explanation of every folder and file, and what role it plays in the protocol.

/circuits

This folder contains all zero-knowledge circuits written in Circom.

 EnergyProof.circom

The core ZK circuit of ADAM v6.0

Verifies that a user reduced energy consumption without leaking their private data

Converts raw energy readings into witness inputs, used to generate a SNARK proof

Used by the frontend (snarkjs) and smart contracts


Purpose:
This is the cryptographic engine that makes ADAM privacy-preserving.


 /contracts

This folder contains all Solidity smart contracts, deployed on EVM-compatible chains, expandable to Qubic.

1️CampusGenesis.sol

The main on-chain registry for ADAM.

Stores verified behavior actions

Emits 이벤트 for analytics dashboards

Links users → behaviors → time window

Works with the verifier contract to ensure valid proofs only


Purpose:
This is ADAM’s public action ledger.


2️ IZKVerifier.sol

An interface defining the required method for any verifier used by ADAM.

function verifyProof(bytes memory proof) external view returns (bool);

Purpose:
Allows different verifier implementations (mock, Groth16, STARK-based, Qubic-based, etc.)
to be plugged into ADAM without changing the main contracts.


3️ RewardDistributor.sol

The reward escrow vault.

Releases credits (BLq or other tokens)

Only triggers after successful ZK verification

Ensures fair distribution for verified contributions


Purpose:
This is ADAM’s incentive layer.


4️DummyVerifier.sol

A simplified verifier for development/demo mode.

Always returns true

Allows frontend tests without generating real proofs

Used for Replit demo version


Purpose:
Fast testing + hackathon demo support.


 /interfaces

Interfaces used by the frontend to interact with Solidity contracts.

 /interfaces/frontend

Contains documentation + example calls for frontend integrations.

ABI references

Instructions for calling verifyProof()

Connection flow for sending proofs to contract

Example JavaScript code


 /interfaces/frontend/docs

Documentation files that describe:

How the frontend connects to the contracts

How proofs are generated

How actions are submitted

How reward distribution is triggered


Purpose:
This folder helps teams integrate ADAM into any app or client system.


README-frontend.md

Explains the full frontend architecture:

Proof generation workflow

How to call circuits

How to prepare witness inputs

How to send proofs to contracts

How to build new UI components around ADAM


Purpose:
Makes the protocol usable for developers building apps on ADAM.
